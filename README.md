# 100 Days of Code

This repository contains a collection of small games and projects that I created during the **100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp** course.  

Each project was created to practice Python concepts such as data structures, GUI's, and object-oriented programming, and working with external libraries like `turtle` and `tkinter`.

## Projects

### Snake Game
A classic Snake game built using Python’s `turtle` module.  
- Control the snake with arrow keys.  
- Eat food to grow longer.  
- Avoid colliding with walls or your own tail.

### Hangman
A text-based Hangman game.  
- Randomly selects a word from a list.  
- Guess letters until the word is complete or you run out of lives.  
- Demonstrates loops, conditionals, and list manipulation.

### Turtle Crossing Game
A simple arcade-style game.  
- Move the turtle to try to cross the road.  
- Dodge cars moving across the screen.  
- Each successful crossing increases the game’s difficulty.

### Pomodoro Timer
A GUI-based Pomodoro productivity timer built with `tkinter`.  
- Implements work/break intervals.  
- Tracks completed work sessions.  
- Plays a sound when time is up.

### 50 States Quiz
A geography quiz game using `turtle` graphics and CSV data.  
- Guess all 50 U.S. states.  
- Correct answers are placed on the map.  
- Uses `pandas` for data handling.
